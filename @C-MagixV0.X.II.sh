# Note: This script focuses on macOS-compatible optimizations. The effectiveness may vary based on system configuration and current state. Always ensure you have backups before running system modification scripts. It's also important to understand that constant cache clearing and disk optimization might not always lead to performance improvements and should be used judiciously.
